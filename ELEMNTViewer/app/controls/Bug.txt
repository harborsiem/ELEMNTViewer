When using the .NET Chart Control of the

namespace System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting
or
namespace System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting

one had to use the class DataPointCollection for showing the points at the chart.
When one want to clear all the points in this collection, then one have to use the Clear() method of this class.

But the Clear method is very slow. One can see it with a DataPointCollection with 10000 points for example. It takes some seconds for clearing.

I had a look at the code and I think I find the problem in the class ChartElementCollection<T> in method ClearItems().
ChartElementCollection<DataPoint> is the base class of DataPointCollection.

class ChartElementCollection<T>
original method:
        protected override void ClearItems()
        {
            SuspendUpdates();
            while (this.Count > 0)
            {
                this.RemoveItem(0);
            }
            ResumeUpdates();
        }

this method is much faster, because the underlying Array of the items don't have to be copied by each call of RemoveItem:
        protected override void ClearItems()
        {
            SuspendUpdates();
            while (this.Count > 0)
            {
                this.RemoveItem(this.Count - 1);
            }
            ResumeUpdates();
        }

Please have a check for the faster version.
